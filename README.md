# CodeAcademy
Repository created to register all the exercises made on CodeAcademy

## What is this repo for?
  
  Here I put all the exercises made by myself (so far) at the Full-Stack Engineer Carrer Path Course on CodeCademy.
  
## What is the current status then?

  I'm actually at unit Git and Github - Part I, in the Bulding Interactive Websites Section
